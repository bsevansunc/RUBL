Mostly forested, these systems occur on floodplains of medium to large rivers where topography and process have resulted in the development of a relatively flat, well-developed floodplain with a complex of upland and wetland temperate alluvial vegetation. Many examples of these systems will contain well-drained levees, terraces and stabilized bars, and some will include herbaceous sloughs and shrub wetlands, particularly in abandoned channels. The substrate is primarily alluvium. The generally fertile soils are usually sandy to loamy but include local clayey and gravelly areas. This complex includes floodplain forests as well as herbaceous sloughs and shrub wetlands. Emergent and vegetated bars of gravel to cobble are included here as well, as are scoured bedrock areas. The dominant structure is forest, where characteristic trees include Acer saccharinum, Populus deltoides, Betula nigra, Celtis laevigata, Liquidambar styraciflua (in the southern half of this group's range), willows, especially Salix nigra in the wettest areas, and Platanus occidentalis, with Fraxinus pennsylvanica, Ulmus americana, Liriodendron tulipifera, Quercus michauxii, Quercus pagoda, and (at least in the Midwest) Quercus macrocarpa in more well-drained areas. The particular mix of tree species will vary across the geographic range of this systems group, with some trees absent over parts of the range; for example, Celtis, Liquidambar, and Quercus macrocarpa are absent from the Susquehanna drainage in Pennsylvania. Understory species are mixed but include shrubs, such as Cephalanthus occidentalis, Cornus drummondii, and Asimina triloba, sedges (Carex spp.) and grasses (such as Elymus hystrix, Elymus canadensis, Chasmanthium latifolium, and others) which sometimes form savanna-like vegetation. Oxbows may support herbaceous vegetation dominated by species including Nelumbo lutea and Typha latifolia. Canebrakes dominated by Arundinaria gigantea ssp. gigantea are present in some areas. Frequently reworked gravelbars may be dominated by young Salix nigra, Platanus occidentalis, or Betula nigra, or they may have sparse vegetation of a wide variety of annual and perennial herbs of weedy habits. Occasional bedrock-scour areas in gorges have distinctive vegetation dominated by perennial herbs rooted in pockets and crevices. Most floodplains are underwater each spring, and some areas may be submerged by high-water events during the growing season. Microtopography determines how long the various habitats are inundated. Floodplain morphology can be altered by occasional severe floods.

It develops on small floodplains and shores along river channels that lack a broad, flat floodplain due to steeper sideslopes, higher gradient, or both. Flooding is the major process affecting the vegetation, with the substrate more rapidly drained than in flat floodplain areas. These systems are affected by flood-scouring in some areas and deposition in others. The vegetation is often a mosaic including various combinations of forest, woodland, shrubland, and herbaceous communities. The non-forested components are particularly distinctive. The succession of woody plants (particularly trees) is retarded by the force of ""flashy,"" high-velocity water traveling down the stream channels. Common trees include Betula nigra, Platanus occidentalis, and Acer negundo. Where somewhat more stable, linear forests develop; typical trees include Liriodendron tulipifera, Liquidambar styraciflua, Acer rubrum, Celtis laevigata, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, Quercus michauxii, and Quercus pagoda. Some common shrubs, occurring as forest/woodland understory or as non-forested shrublands, include Alnus serrulata, Cephalanthus occidentalis, Cornus amomum, Lindera benzoin, Salix caroliniana and other Salix spp., Toxicodendron radicans, and, over parts of the range, Fothergilla major, Hypericum densiflorum, Itea virginica, and Rhododendron arborescens. More southern examples may contain Hydrangea quercifolia, Hypericum densiflorum, and Morella cerifera (= Myrica cerifera var. cerifera); Hamamelis vernalis is characteristic in the Ozark/Ouachita region. Open, flood-scoured rivershore prairies feature Andropogon gerardii, Sorghastrum nutans, Schizachyrium scoparium, Chasmanthium latifolium, Tripsacum dactyloides, and/or Panicum virgatum. Carex torta is typical of wetter areas near the channel. Forbs are diverse and variable from occurrence to occurrence. Some characteristic forbs are Baptisia australis, Conoclinium coelestinum (= Eupatorium coelestinum), Coreopsis pubescens, Coreopsis tripteris, Elephantopus carolinianus, Helenium autumnale, Hydrocotyle sp., Ludwigia leptocarpa, Lycopus spp., Orontium aquaticum, Osmunda regalis var. spectabilis, Oxypolis rigidior, Phlox carolina, Pityopsis graminifolia var. latifolia, Rudbeckia laciniata, and Vernonia gigantea.

Small seeps and fens can often be found within these habitats, especially at the headwaters and terraces of streams. These areas are typically dominated by primarily wetland obligate species of sedges (Carex spp.), ferns (Osmunda spp.), and other herbaceous species such as Impatiens capensis. Flood-scouring is a powerful and ecologically important abrasive force along these riparian habitats. However, in contrast to larger floodplain systems, these systems have little to no floodplain development (i.e., floodplains, if present, are not differentiated into levees, sloughs, ridges, terraces, and abandoned channel segments) and often contain cobblebars and steep banks. They are typically higher gradient than larger floodplains and experience periodic, strong flooding of short duration.","."

Most occur along medium to large rivers where topography and process have resulted in the development of a complex of upland and wetland, temperate, alluvial vegetation on generally flat topography. This complex includes floodplain forests, with Acer saccharinum characteristic, as well as herbaceous sloughs and shrub wetlands. Most areas are underwater each spring; microtopography determines how long the various habitats are inundated. Associated trees include Acer rubrum and Carpinus caroliniana, the latter frequent but never abundant. On terraces or in more calcareous areas, Acer saccharum or Quercus rubra may be locally prominent, with Betula alleghaniensis and Fraxinus spp. Salix nigra is characteristic of the levees adjacent to the channel. Common shrubs include Cornus amomum and Viburnum spp. The herb layer in the forested portions often features abundant spring ephemerals, giving way to a fern-dominated understory in many areas by mid-summer. Non-forested wetlands associated with these systems include shrub-dominated and graminoid-herbaceous vegetation.  Two uncommon expressions occur along sub-boreal rivers in northernmost New England and adjacent Canada: ice-scour rivershores and boreal floodplain forests. The ice-scour rivershores lack extensive forests because spring iceflows prevent floodplain forests from developing, except in small and widely scattered pockets; the vegetation consists of shrublands, tall grasslands, graminoid-forb-dwarf-shrub shoreline seeps, and rivershore outcrops. Characteristic shrubs include Alnus incana and Alnus viridis ssp. crispa (= Alnus crispa), Myrica gale, Cornus sericea, Salix eriocephala and many other Salix spp., and Dasiphora fruticosa ssp. floribunda. Characteristic herbaceous species vary with the setting, although Calamagrostis canadensis is ubiquitous. Soils in some areas remain saturated by seepage waters; other patches are well-drained for most of the growing season. These rivershores are flooded every spring, with summer floods in occasional years. The extent of ice-scour varies from year to year according to the snowpack and conditions during ice-out. The location and extent of shrub versus herb cover will vary in time and space according to how recent and severe the scour events have been. Boreal floodplain forests, north of the range of Acer saccharinum, develop in areas not strongly influenced by ice-scour (i.e., depositional), where topography and process have resulted in a complex of upland and wetland alluvial vegetation.

Depositional landforms are larger, and communities can be more segregated. Along the Mississippi River, low bottomlands are characteristic. These are seasonally flooded backswamps, with flooding usually more frequent than every two years, generally by still water that may be impounded behind natural levees. Vegetation generally includes forests dominated by bottomland hardwood species and other trees tolerant of flooding. However, herbaceous and shrub vegetation may be present in certain areas, particularly on recently deposited bars and in oxbow lakes. Most examples are nearly contiguous over large areas, broken only by the river itself. Higher terraces may have a mosaic of floodplain and upland systems, and may include nonriverine wetland systems. Some of the most typical and characteristic tree species found in stands of this systems group include Taxodium distichum, Nyssa aquatica, Acer saccharinum, Platanus occidentalis, Populus deltoides, Acer negundo, and Salix nigra. Other trees may include Celtis laevigata, Carya illinoinensis, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, Gleditsia triacanthos, Liquidambar styraciflua, Nyssa biflora, Quercus laurifolia, Quercus lyrata, Quercus michauxii, Quercus nigra, Quercus pagoda, Quercus phellos, Quercus similis, Quercus texana, Quercus virginiana, Salix nigra, Ulmus americana, and Ulmus crassifolia. Three distinct groups of associations can be recognized. The lowest, wettest areas have some combination of Taxodium distichum and Nyssa aquatica dominating. Natural levees and riverfronts have a diverse mixture of trees that typically includes Platanus occidentalis, Celtis laevigata, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, Acer saccharinum, Acer negundo, and other species that benefit from the high light levels and heavy alluvial deposition of these sites. Soils are typically sandier than those of the lower bottomlands. Arundinaria gigantea (giant cane) is a common understory in these forests on natural levees and higher point bars, and may become dominant after thinning or removal of the overstory. Willow and cottonwood sandbars may have an open-canopy (woodland-type) structure. Moderate to high parts of the floodplain away from the levee are usually dominated by bottomland hardwoods, various mixtures of wetland oaks, including Quercus laurifolia, Quercus michauxii, Quercus pagoda, and sometimes a number of other oak species, along with Liquidambar styraciflua or other species. The wettest forests can be simple in structure, with an understory but little shrub or herb layer; others tend to have well-developed subcanopy, shrub, and herb layers. Woody vines are usually prominent. Shrubs and small trees include Alnus serrulata, Arundinaria gigantea, Carpinus caroliniana, Cephalanthus occidentalis, Clethra alnifolia, Cornus foemina, Crataegus viridis, Forestiera acuminata, Ilex decidua, Itea virginica, Morella cerifera, Planera aquatica, Sabal minor, and Sebastiania fruticosa. Vines may include Berchemia scandens and Smilax bona-nox. Herbaceous species may include Boehmeria cylindrica, Carex complanata, Carex debilis, Carex intumescens, Carex joorii, Leersia virginica, Lycopus virginicus, Mikania scandens, Saccharum baldwinii, and Typha latifolia. Aquatic and floating herbs include Lemna minor, Nelumbo lutea, Nuphar lutea ssp. advena, and Nymphaea odorata.","."
